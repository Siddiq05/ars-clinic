              <strong>Implants are substitutes for lost teeth.</strong> In this
              procedure, there is no need to cut down the adjacent teeth for
              crowns to support a bridge. Instead, dental implants replace the
              missing teeth by placing artificial roots directly into the
              jawbone, offering a more reliable and natural solution without
              affecting neighboring teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designed for toothless areas, this treatment involves implanting
              artificial dental roots made of titanium, a biocompatible metal
              that integrates with the jawbone, providing a natural feel and
              aesthetic satisfaction. This procedure is safe and offers a better
              alternative to traditional bridges or dentures, as it doesn't
              require altering the adjacent teeth. The placement of an implant
              requires a small operation carried out under local anesthesia,
              similar to that used for tooth extractions. Dental implants can
              support various dental prostheses, such as crowns,
              implant-supported bridges, or dentures, and they can also serve as
              anchors for orthodontic tooth movement. The use of dental implants
              enables unidirectional tooth movement without the reciprocal
              action that occurs with traditional braces.

            <h2>Implant supported denture and bridge</h2>
            <p>
              Implant-supported dentures are a permanent solution when all teeth
              are missing. They are fixed, prevent bone resorption, and provide
              a natural appearance without altering taste sensations. When a
              single tooth is missing, one implant is sufficient to fill the
              space and restore a tooth similar to your natural teeth.
            </p>

            <p>
              An implant for a single missing tooth eliminates the need to cut
              down adjacent teeth for a bridge. Unlike bridges, which rely on
              the health of surrounding teeth, implants last a lifetime. As more
              teeth are lost with age, existing implants can support fixed
              complete dentures. Traditional dentures often cause discomfort and
              difficulties in eating or speaking due to movement, whereas
              implant-supported teeth remain stable. Additionally, implants
              integrate with the bone, preventing bone loss—unlike crowns and
              bridges—thus delaying visible signs of aging.

            <h2>Time Required</h2>
            <p>
              It takes a minimum of 6 months to complete the implant procedure
              as it is performed in two stages. First, the implant is placed in
              the jaw and left to bond with the bone for complete healing. This
              process takes at least 3 months for the lower jaw and 6 months for
              the upper jaw.
            </p>
            <p>
              A temporary crown is placed during the healing phase until the
              permanent crown is fixed. Once the implant has fully integrated
              with the bone, the final replacement tooth is securely attached to
              the implant.

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>
              There are several advantages to dental implants. An implant used
              to replace a single tooth avoids the need to cut down the adjacent
              teeth for crowns to support a bridge.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, implants serve a lifetime, unlike bridges, which
              depend on the health of adjacent teeth. Implants integrate into
              the bone, preventing bone loss, unlike crowns and bridges, thus
              delaying the signs of aging.
            </p>

            <p>
              Implants are a safe, well-established, tried, and tested
              treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
              They provide an aesthetically perfect solution for missing teeth.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cleaning around an implant-supported tooth is as simple as
              cleaning a natural tooth.

                  It depends on the state of the bone in your jaw. Your dentist
                  will arrange for a special radiograph to assess the amount of
                  bone still there. If there is not enough, or if it isn’t
                  healthy enough, grafting or placing of bone may be required
                  prior to placing implants in that area first.

                  Placing the implants requires a small operation. This will be
                  carried out under local anesthesia, the same as for the
                  removal of teeth. You will not feel any pain at the time, but
                  you may feel some discomfort during the week following the
                  surgery. This is usually due to stitches and the normal
                  healing process, which can be relieved by the prescribed
                  medication.

                  No. The implants need to bond (integrate) with the bone after
                  they have been placed. This takes at least 3 months in the
                  lower jaw and 6 months in the upper jaw. If you are having
                  one, two, or three teeth replaced, you will have a temporary
                  restoration in the meantime. If you have complete dentures,
                  then you can wear them throughout the healing period once they
                  have been adjusted after surgery.

                  It takes up to 6 months from the initial assessment to the

                  attached to the implants. However, if only the lower jaw is
                  involved, it may take around 5 months. A lot depends on how
                  complicated your treatment is. Your dentist will be able to
                  give you a timetable once the surgery has been done. In the
                  meantime, immediate loading teeth or temporary crowns are

                  No, unless you’re only having a single tooth replaced.
                  Normally, four to six implants are used to replace all the

                  teeth. For a few missing teeth, two or three implants may be

                  This happens very rarely. If the implant becomes loose during
                  the healing period or just after, it is easily removed, and
                  healing takes place in the normal way. Once the jaw has
                  healed, another implant can be placed, or the dentist can make
                  a bridge using the implanted false teeth that have ‘taken’.
