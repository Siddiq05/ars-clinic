              Crowns are used to restore missing or damaged teeth, enhancing
              both function and aesthetics. They can be crafted from various
              materials, including gold, metal, porcelain, and tooth-colored
              zirconium. White zirconium crowns, in particular, offer a natural
              appearance, boosting confidence and improving your smile.

            <h2>Ceramic Fused to Metal Crowns</h2>
            <p>
              Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) dental crowns feature a metal base
              for strength and a porcelain overlay for a natural appearance.
              Unlike metallic crowns, they can be color-matched to adjacent
              teeth. However, over time, the porcelain layer may wear down, and
              the metal beneath can become visible, sometimes appearing as a
              dark line near the gums. As a result, PFM crowns may require
              replacement or upgrading after several years.

            <h2>All Ceramic crowns</h2>
            <p>
              All-ceramic or all-porcelain dental crowns offer the best natural
              color match compared to other crown types, making them an ideal
              choice for front teeth. Additionally, they are a great option for
              individuals with metal allergies, ensuring both aesthetics and
              biocompatibility.

            <h2>Zirconium crowns</h2>
            <p>
              Zirconium is the strongest all-ceramic material available today,
              making it an excellent choice for those with metal sensitivities
              or those seeking aesthetically superior, metal-free restorations.
              Its biocompatibility has been well-established in the medical
              field over the years. Zirconium crowns and bridges are
              exceptionally durable and can be used in any area of the mouth.
              They can withstand the biting pressure of both front teeth and the
              grinding forces of back teeth. Their natural appearance closely
              mimics real teeth, making them a highly desirable option in modern
              dental treatments.

            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>
              Restoring the functionality of your teeth typically requires three
              appointments:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>First Appointment:</b> Your teeth will be carefully shaped as
                needed, and precise measurements will be taken to ensure a
                perfect fit for your new crowns.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Second Appointment:</b> A trial fitting of your crowns will
                be conducted to assess their functionality and aesthetics. Any
                necessary adjustments will be made at this stage to enhance
                comfort and appearance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Third Appointment:</b> Your customized crowns will be
                securely fixed, restoring your smile and bite to optimal
                function.

                <p>
                  When a tooth is malformed, severely decayed, cracked, or
                  broken, it can be restored with a crown. A crown is a fixed
                  prosthetic device designed to protect the tooth from further
                  decay and provide strength to the remaining tooth structure,
                  allowing it to function properly. Bridges, on the other hand,
                  are used to fill the gaps left by one or two missing teeth,
                  supported by the adjacent healthy teeth. Both crowns and
                  bridges not only restore the functionality of the teeth but
                  also enhance their appearance.

                  Does Crown and Bridges make your teeth weaker?

              <div class="answer-container">
                <p>
                  Crowns and bridges do not weaken your teeth; in fact, they
                  strengthen them by protecting against further decay and
                  potential damage. Decayed teeth are often brittle and can
                  easily chip or break, posing a risk. By placing a crown around
                  a weakened tooth, it adds stability and strength, preventing
                  it from further deterioration and ensuring its functionality.

                  Dental crowns and bridges offer a permanent solution to dental
                  issues and can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years, depending on
                  the quality of the materials used. Higher-quality crowns tend
                  to last longer, while lower-quality crowns can be upgraded
                  over time if necessary. Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is
                  crucial to prolonging the lifespan of crowns and bridges,
                  ensuring they continue to function and look their best for
                  many years.

                  Zirconia is the preferred material for dental crowns due to
                  its metal-free composition, making it highly biocompatible.
                  Unlike metal crowns, Zirconia allows the gums to naturally
                  grow over it, giving it a more aesthetically pleasing
                  appearance. Additionally, Zirconia helps prevent gum recession
                  over time, a common issue seen with metal crowns.
