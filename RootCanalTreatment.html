              A tooth has three layers: enamel, dentin, and pulp. When the
              cavity is so deep that it has reached the pulp, Root Canal
              Treatment (RCT) is necessary. In this procedure, all the infection
              from within the tooth is removed, all the canals in the root are
              cleaned, and medicament is placed. Afterward, the tooth is sealed
              to prevent any further infection from seeping in.
            </p>
            <p>
              After performing Root Canal Treatment, the tooth becomes weak and
              brittle, making it more prone to damage. Therefore, a post-Root
              Canal Treatment crown is crucial to protect the tooth and restore
              its strength and function.

            <p>
              Placing a crown helps the tooth become strong and capable of
              withstanding the forces, just like a normal tooth.

              Nowadays, even badly broken teeth can be saved by Root Canal
              Treatment and rebuilding with a metal or white fiber post and
              core, as long as even 1-2 mm of the tooth is visible.

                  Root canal treatments are performed with local anesthesia,
                  making the procedure comfortable and pain-free. With modern
                  rotary instruments, the process is also faster compared to
                  traditional hand tools.

                <p>
                  The number of visits depends on the extent of the infection.
                  However, in most cases, the entire root canal treatment and
                  crown placement can be completed in 2 to 3 visits, usually
                  within a week. More visits may be necessary for severe
                  infections or swelling.

                  Why is a crown necessary after a root canal treatment?

                <p>
                  After a root canal, the treated tooth may become brittle and
                  more prone to breaking. A crown helps reinforce and protect
                  the tooth, allowing it to function properly under the pressure
                  of chewing. The crown also seals the tooth, preventing
                  reinfection and protecting the root canal filling.

                <p>
                  Yes, as long as at least 1mm of healthy tooth structure
                  remains visible, root canal therapy can still be performed. In
                  such cases, a post and core may be used to rebuild the tooth
                  and provide a strong foundation for the crown, ensuring the
                  tooth can handle chewing forces.

                <p>
                  Root canal treatment is necessary when the infection reaches
                  the innermost part of the tooth, which contains nerves and
                  blood vessels. A filling alone can't effectively treat this
                  kind of infection. The infected tissue needs to be removed to
                  prevent the spread of bacteria.

                <p>
                  Preserving the tooth through root canal treatment helps
                  maintain the surrounding bone structure and keeps adjacent
                  teeth in their proper positions. This helps prevent further
                  dental issues and ensures the integrity of the bite.

                  Root canal treatments have a success rate of over 95%, thanks
                  to advancements in dental technology. The use of precise
                  tools, such as apex locators, digital imaging, rotary
                  instruments, and high-quality materials for post and core
                  restorations, contribute to the high success rate and
                  long-term effectiveness of the treatment.
