                  When a tooth is malformed, severely decayed, cracked, or
                  broken, it can be restored with a crown. A crown is a fixed
                  prosthetic device designed to protect the tooth from further
                  decay and provide strength to the remaining tooth structure,
                  allowing it to function properly. Bridges, on the other hand,
                  are used to fill the gaps left by one or two missing teeth,
                  supported by the adjacent healthy teeth. Both crowns and
                  bridges not only restore the functionality of the teeth but
                  also enhance their appearance.

                  Does Crown and Bridges make your teeth weaker?

                <p>
                  Crowns and bridges do not weaken your teeth; in fact, they
                  strengthen them by protecting against further decay and
                  potential damage. Decayed teeth are often brittle and can
                  easily chip or break, posing a risk. By placing a crown around
                  a weakened tooth, it adds stability and strength, preventing
                  it from further deterioration and ensuring its functionality.

                  Are dental crowns and bridges permanent or temporary?

                <p>
                  Dental crowns and bridges offer a permanent solution to dental
                  issues and can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years, depending on
                  the quality of the materials used. Higher-quality crowns tend
                  to last longer, while lower-quality crowns can be upgraded
                  over time if necessary. Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is
                  crucial to prolonging the lifespan of crowns and bridges,
                  ensuring they continue to function and look their best for
                  many years.

                  <strong>Zirconia/E-max Crowns:</strong> These are the latest

                <p>
                  <strong>Laser Sintered Crowns:</strong> These crowns feature a
                  unique design with an inner core made of metal that is laser
                  sintered onto the die to maintain minimal metal thickness. The
                  outer layer is made of tooth-colored ceramic, offering a blend

                <p>
                  Zirconia is the preferred material for dental crowns due to
                  its metal-free composition, making it highly biocompatible.
                  Unlike metal crowns, Zirconia allows the gums to naturally
                  grow over it, giving it a more aesthetically pleasing
                  appearance. Additionally, Zirconia helps prevent gum recession
                  over time, a common issue seen with metal crowns.

                  It depends on the state of the bone in your jaw. Your dentist
                  will arrange for a special radiograph to assess the amount of

                  Placing the implants requires a small operation. This will be
                  carried out under local anesthesia, the same as for the
                  removal of teeth. You will not feel any pain at the time, but
                  you may feel some discomfort during the week following the
                  surgery. This is usually due to stitches and the normal
                  healing process, which can be relieved by the prescribed
                  medication.

                  No. The implants need to bond (integrate) with the bone after
                  they have been placed. This takes at least 3 months in the
                  lower jaw and 6 months in the upper jaw. If you are having
                  one, two, or three teeth replaced, you will have a temporary
                  restoration in the meantime. If you have complete dentures,
                  then you can wear them throughout the healing period once they
                  have been adjusted after surgery.

                  Gaps between the teeth can be closed either by pulling the
                  teeth together with braces orthodontically, or cosmetically by
                  placing porcelain laminates, lumineers, or metal-free crowns.
                  If spacing is the only issue, either of these options is
                  suitable. However, if teeth are malformed or missing,
                  resulting in gaps, cosmetic correction is usually a more

                  Cosmetic dentistry requires extensive knowledge of aesthetic

                  If you are young and your teeth are misaligned but in the
                  perfect shape and colour, then braces or orthodontic treatment
                  is the right path for you. However, if you are unhappy with
                  the shape or colour or texture of your teeth then looking at
                  cosmetic dentistry is a sensible option. Even in such cases,
                  braces can be used for pre-aligning the teeth where required.
                  Here; pre-aligning with use of recent advances like Inman
                  aligners can considerably shorten treatment time. The basic
                  principle to follow here would be â€“ â€˜Treat young patients
                  Idealistically and treat adult patients Realisticallyâ€™.

                  Orthodontic treatment requires minimum of 8-10 months to align
                  the teeth. In adult patients, where minor corrections for only
                  front teeth are targeted, 6-7 months should be adequate. With
                  use of Inman Aligners, the treatment span can be shortened to
                  around 12-16 weeks. In the first visit, the braces will be
                  placed, followed by monthly recalls to monitor and guide the
                  progress.

                  After a root canal, the treated tooth may become brittle and
                  more prone to breaking. A crown helps reinforce and protect
                  the tooth, allowing it to function properly under the pressure
                  of chewing. The crown also seals the tooth, preventing

                  Root canal treatment is necessary when the infection reaches
                  the innermost part of the tooth, which contains nerves and
                  blood vessels. A filling alone can't effectively treat this
                  kind of infection. The infected tissue needs to be removed to
                  prevent the spread of bacteria.

                <p>
                  Preserving the tooth through root canal treatment helps
                  maintain the surrounding bone structure and keeps adjacent
                  teeth in their proper positions. This helps prevent further
                  dental issues and ensures the integrity of the bite.

                  Root canal treatments have a success rate of over 95%, thanks
                  to advancements in dental technology. The use of precise
                  tools, such as apex locators, digital imaging, rotary
                  instruments, and high-quality materials for post and core
                  restorations, contribute to the high success rate and
                  long-term effectiveness of the treatment.
