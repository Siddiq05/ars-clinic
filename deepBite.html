              Traumatic occlusion, or a misaligned bite, occurs when the teeth
              and jaws do not align properly. This condition is often genetic
              but can also result from factors such as crowded, worn, or decayed
              teeth, poor or failing dental work, and missing teeth—especially
              missing back teeth. Habits like thumb sucking, teeth clenching,
              and grinding (bruxism) can further contribute to the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              In adults, the absence of back teeth can worsen a deep bite,
              leading to a collapsed bite and lower facial structure, which
              creates a more aged appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among all bite disorders, a deep bite is the most damaging to both
              dental health and jaw joints. It affects facial aesthetics by
              reducing facial height, increasing wrinkle lines, and accelerating
              signs of aging due to excessive wear on the back teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
              While often perceived as merely a cosmetic concern, a bad bite has
              serious implications. It can cause extensive damage to the teeth
              and gums and contribute to headaches and temporomandibular joint
              (TMJ) disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
              A deep bite specifically occurs when the upper front teeth
              excessively overlap the lower front teeth, leading to potential
              oral health complications.
            </p>

          <div class="row">
            <h2>Why Treat Deep Bite?</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike other dental conditions that present immediate pain,
              traumatic occlusion and deep bite are silent, progressive
              disorders. Similar to chronic diseases like cancer, they develop
              gradually through a series of small, seemingly insignificant
              changes over time. Since the damage occurs slowly, it often goes
              unnoticed until it reaches an advanced stage. The first noticeable
              symptom is usually a sudden onset of generalized tooth
              sensitivity, which often appears only after significant and
              irreversible damage has already taken place.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Features of Deep Bite</h2>
            <p>
              In the initial stages, signs of a deep bite may include noticeable
              wear on the lower front teeth, appearing as surface flattening.
              Craze lines or thin fracture lines may develop in the front teeth,
              accompanied by plaque buildup and gum bleeding, particularly in
              the lower front region. As the upper teeth completely overlap the
              lower teeth, overall dental function declines, leading to
              difficulties in chewing food effectively.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/Deep-bite-2-2.webp" />
            <p>
              If left untreated, the edges of the lower teeth will undergo early
              and extensive wear, sometimes affecting the upper teeth as well,
              leading to generalized sensitivity. Sudden chipping of teeth and
              frequent gum bleeding, especially while brushing, may also occur.
              Over time, the gum tissue behind the upper teeth and in front of
              the lower teeth can become damaged due to excessive pressure from
              the biting edges, resulting in gingival recession. This condition
              can also impact your smile, as wear on the upper teeth alters
              their chewing surfaces, and gum recession creates an unesthetic
              appearance. In severe cases, it may lead to the loss of front
              teeth. Additionally, bad breath may develop as a side effect of
              gum disease and plaque accumulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the advanced stage, excessive wear on the teeth leads to
              generalized sensitivity and pain in severely affected teeth.
              Gingival recession becomes more pronounced, exposing the tooth
              roots and increasing the risk of further complications.
              Additionally, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders may develop,
              causing pain in the jaw joints and muscles, often leading to
              discomfort while chewing, speaking, or even at rest.

            <h2>Treatment of Deep Bite by Cosmetic Crown</h2>
            <p>
              A deep bite, even in adults, can now be effectively corrected
              using various advanced restorative treatment options.
            </p>
            <p>
              The treatment focuses on restoring the correct bite by raising it
              with crowns on the back teeth and replacing any missing teeth to
              ensure equal distribution of chewing forces.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the front teeth are already worn or chipped, metal-free crowns
              or dental laminates may be used to restore aesthetics and
              function. Additionally, a professional gum cleaning (scaling) may
              be recommended to maintain optimal oral health.
            </p>
            <img src="./assets/Deep-bite-3.jpg" alt="metal-ceramic-crowns" />
            <p>
              In advanced stages, when patients experience pain, generalized
              sensitivity, and gum recession (gum deterioration), comprehensive
              treatment is necessary. Along with placing crowns on the back
              teeth to restore the bite, teeth affected by severe pain may
              require root canal therapy. The front teeth, if significantly
              damaged, will also need crowns for protection and aesthetics.
              Additionally, gum surgery may be required in cases where gum
              recession is severe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Cost of Treatment</h2>
            <p>
              The cost of treatment varies based on the quality of crowns chosen
              to restore the bite and the number of teeth involved in the
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early stages, when no significant damage has occurred, a
              night guard (a protective template) may be provided as a
              preventive measure. While it does not treat the condition, it
              significantly slows its progression and helps prevent jaw joint
              (TMJ) and muscle pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              If detected at a younger age, before significant tooth wear
              (attrition) has taken place, the condition can be corrected by
              repositioning the teeth into a stable, proper alignment using
              braces or an anterior bite plane, a treatment approach known as
              orthodontic correction.

                  Even if your lower teeth do not touch your upper teeth in a
                  resting position, you may still have a deep bite. When you
                  chew, your lower teeth can continuously strike the upper
                  teeth, transferring excessive pressure from the teeth to the
                  gums and, eventually, to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
                  Over time, this can lead to discomfort, tooth wear, and
                  jaw-related issues.

                  A deep bite places excessive and unnatural stress on the jaw
                  muscles and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) over time. This
                  continuous strain can lead to muscle soreness and joint pain,
                  even during normal activities like chewing and speaking. The
                  constant pressure on the TMJ can gradually damage the bones
                  and cartilage, potentially resulting in long-term discomfort,
                  restricted jaw movement, and other TMJ-related disorders.

                  Deep Bite is a common dental condition, but it can lead to
                  serious complications if left untreated. While it's not an

                  A night guard is a protective device worn over the teeth while
                  sleeping. It is often used in the early stages of a deep bite
