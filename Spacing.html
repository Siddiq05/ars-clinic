              Diastema refers to a gap or space that occurs between two teeth.
              It is most commonly used to describe an open space between the
              upper incisors, which are the front teeth. This gap can occur
              naturally or due to other dental factors.

            <h2>Cause</h2>
            <p>
              Diastema occurs when there is an imbalance between the size of the
              teeth and the jaw. It can sometimes be caused or worsened by the
              action of the labial frenulum (the tissue that connects the lip to
              the gum), tongue thrusting, or the spreading of teeth due to
              periodontal diseases.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>
              There are two options for treating diastema (spacing between the
              teeth):
            </p>

            <p>
              The first option involves orthodontically moving the teeth using
              braces, which typically requires 10-12 months for correction.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second option involves the placement of porcelain veneers or
              metal-free crowns. Porcelain veneers are thin, eggshell-like
              pieces of porcelain applied directly over the tooth structure
              after some initial preparation. Once the porcelain veneers are
              fused to the underlying tooth structure, they can restore the
              appearance of straight teeth and close gaps without the need for
              braces. Additionally, the color, shape, and size of the teeth can
              be customized to the patient's preference for overall smile
              enhancement. The greatest advantage of porcelain veneers is that
              the treatment can be completed in just two painless visits.

              <div class="answer-container">
                <p>
                  Gaps between the teeth can be closed either by pulling the
                  teeth together with braces orthodontically, or cosmetically by
                  placing porcelain laminates, lumineers, or metal-free crowns.
                  If spacing is the only issue, either of these options is
                  suitable. However, if teeth are malformed or missing,
                  resulting in gaps, cosmetic correction is usually a more
                  viable option.

                  It is an artistic method used to align your teeth and enhance
                  your smile. In this process, the crowns are designed to close
                  the gaps between the teeth. Laminates and Lumineers are
                  relatively non-invasive methods to achieve gap closure while
                  also changing the color and shape of the teeth, especially
                  when the teeth are perfectly aligned.

                  There is no pain during or after the procedure as we numb the

                  clinic with temporary crowns, so there is no need to worry
                  about pain during or after the procedure.

                  Cosmetic dentistry requires extensive knowledge of aesthetic
                  principles, a keen eye for beauty, and experience working with
                  superior materials such as rubber base, light body, and
                  bonding cements. Expertise in the methodical sequencing of
                  treatments is crucial to minimize the number of visits and
                  provide the best aesthetic results without compromising the
                  integrity of the tooth. Thus, a dentist with a Masterâ€™s degree
                  and considerable experience is always recommended.
