              Early childhood caries, also known as nursing bottle caries, is a
              very common bacterial infection characterized by cavities that
              most often show up on a child’s upper front teeth but can also
              affect other teeth. It first appears as white spots near the gum
              line. These spots are hard to see at first, but if caught early,
              they can be stopped from progressing into cavities. As it gets
              worse, they can look like brown spots, holes, or broken teeth,
              which will require more involved procedures to fix. It is very
              important to get treatment early to stop the decay from getting
              worse.

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most significant causes of nursing bottle caries is
              when a child goes to bed with a bottle filled with milk or juice –
              anything except water. Bacteria in the mouth use these sugars as
              food, producing acids that attack the teeth. After repeated
              exposure, the teeth begin to decay. Nursing bottle caries usually
              affect children below the age of 6 years. If your infant falls
              asleep while breastfeeding, they are also at risk.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>
              A dull white discoloration appears along the gum line on the front
              upper teeth, indicating early decay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cavities may develop around the neck of the teeth in a circular
              pattern, signaling progressive damage.
            </p>
            <p>
              In severe cases, the teeth may decay entirely, leaving behind only
              dark brown or black root remnants.

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Preventive Treatment:</strong><br />
              Fluoride exposure using child-specific fluoridated toothpaste,
              mouthwash, and fluoride application are effective ways to prevent
              cavities.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Fluoride Application:</strong><br />
              Professional fluoride application is recommended when white
              lesions appear on the tooth surface. It prevents further
              demineralization and halts cavity progression. Commonly used
              solutions include 5% sodium fluoride varnish (NaFV; 2.26% F,
              22,600 ppm F) and acidulated phosphate fluoride. This is typically
              done for children under six years old.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Pit and Fissure Sealant:</strong><br />
              A plastic resin applied to the grooves of the chewing surface to
              prevent cavities. It is recommended for young primary and
              permanent teeth as a preventive measure, even when discoloration
              is not yet visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Diet Modification:</strong><br />
              Food habits play a crucial role in the occurrence of Early
              Childhood Caries (ECC). Monitoring your child’s diet and referring
              to an appropriate food chart can help in prevention.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Therapeutic Treatment:</strong></p>

            <p>
              <strong>Restoration:</strong><br />
              Fillings are performed when cavities are contained within the
              walls of the tooth.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Crowns:</strong><br />
              Used when a cavity breaks a tooth wall, ensuring protection and
              restoration.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Root Canal Treatment:</strong><br />
              If decay reaches the nerve, pulpectomy (root canal treatment) is
              required. A crown is placed afterward for function and aesthetics.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Extraction:</strong><br />
              Severely decayed teeth, reduced to root stumps, require
              extraction. For young children, space maintainers help guide the
              eruption of permanent teeth.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Treatment Charges:</strong></p>

            <p>Fluoride application: Rs 2,000 per arch</p>
            <p>Pit and Fissure Sealant: Rs 500 per tooth</p>

                  Early Childhood Caries is one of the most common preventable
                  dental diseases seen amongst young children in their milk
                  teeth. It commonly presents as multiple decays seen in the
                  upper teeth, making them brittle. Lower front teeth are
                  usually protected by the tongue, hence much damage is not seen
                  in them. The presence of multiple decays is due to prolonged
                  contact between sugars in food and the bacteria present on the
                  decayed surface of the teeth. It is caused by the following
                  reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>

                  These are absolutely pain-free procedures once the numbness

                  Conscious sedation and general anaesthesia are behavioral
                  control techniques increasingly used in pediatric dentistry.
                  Inhalation sedation utilizing nitrous oxide-oxygen has been a
                  primary technique in the management of anxiety and dental
                  fears. It is usually the technique of choice for pediatric
                  dental conscious sedation, children with special needs, and
                  for adults. The technique has an extremely high success rate
                  coupled with a very low rate of adverse effects and
                  complications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dental procedures under general anaesthesia are a therapeutic
                  option for many patients, providing high-quality dental care
                  when conventional dental treatment is not a viable option. If
                  you are specifically looking for treatment under conscious
                  sedation or general anaesthesia, you can always first consult
                  your pediatrician to confirm if the child is fit for the same
                  before meeting our pediatric dentist for a consultation.
