              Dental Fluorosis refers to changes in the appearance of teeth
              caused by overexposure to fluoride, particularly during the period
              when permanent teeth are forming under the gums (usually between 3
              months and 8 years of age). Once the teeth break through the gums,
              enamel fluorosis cannot develop further, but the stains and spots
              left by fluorosis are permanent and may darken over time.
            </p>
            <p>Causes of Dental Fluorosis:</p>
            <p>
              The main cause of dental fluorosis is water fluoridation, which is
              usually an aesthetic concern. Severe cases can result from
              exposure to water with fluoride levels exceeding the recommended
              amounts, or other sources of fluoride, such as:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Brick tea</strong> or
              <strong>high-fluoride coal pollution</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Fluoridated mouth rinses</strong> and
              <strong>toothpastes</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Bottled water</strong> not tested for fluoride content.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Inappropriate fluoride supplements</strong> usage.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Ingestion of foods</strong>, especially those imported
              from other countries with higher fluoride levels.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Public water fluoridation</strong>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Classification:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Very Mild:</strong> Small opaque, paper-white areas
                covering less than 25% of the tooth surface.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mild:</strong> Opaque white areas covering less than 50%
                of the tooth surface.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Moderate:</strong> All surfaces are affected, showing
                brown staining and attrition of enamel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Severe:</strong> Shows marked pitting and brown spots
                affecting all the tooth surfaces.

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Dental fluorosis</strong> is cosmetically treatable.
              Different treatment options include:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Tooth Bleaching:</strong> Used for lighter cases and
              superficial staining.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Microabrasion:</strong> A procedure that removes surface
              stains for a smoother, whiter appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Conservative Composite Restorations:</strong> Used for
              more severe cases where bleaching and microabrasion are not
              enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Porcelain Veneers:</strong> A more permanent solution for
              severe cases of fluorosis that result in unattractive
              discoloration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, <strong>microabrasion</strong> and
              <strong>bleaching</strong> are utilized for superficial staining,
              while the more <strong>conservative restorations</strong> are used
              for more unaesthetic situations, such as severe fluorosis.

            <p>
              A patient with <strong>moderate fluorosis</strong> presented with
              fluoride staining on the front teeth. The front six teeth were
              treated with <strong>cosmetic veneers</strong> to cover the
              staining and restore the natural appearance of the smile.

              This treatment helped to correct the discoloration caused by
              fluorosis, providing an aesthetic solution and improving the
              patient's overall smile.

                  No, in fact placement of the crowns will protect your brittle
                  teeth from the occlusal forces thereby increasing the life and
                  functionality of your teeth.

                <p>
                  Yes, cosmetic crowns can provide a long-lasting solution,
                  especially when high-quality materials are used. However, the
                  durability of the crown largely depends on proper oral
                  hygiene, regular dental checkups, and maintaining a balanced
                  bite. With good care, cosmetic crowns can last for many years,
                  enhancing both the functionality and appearance of your teeth.

                  Porcelain veneers are thin ceramic shells that cover only the
                  front surface of your teeth, offering aesthetic improvement.
                  On the other hand, zirconia crowns are much stronger and cover
                  all surfaces of your teeth, providing both strength and
                  durability.

                  No! Cosmetic crowns never stain. These crowns have polished
                  surfaces, making them resistant to acids and staining. You can
                  have any kind of food without having to worry about getting
                  your teeth stained!
